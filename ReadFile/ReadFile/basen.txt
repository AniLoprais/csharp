For a bit of love, I'd roam the world through and through,
with the head uncovered and barefoot I would go,
I'd walk in the ice, eternal May in the soul
I'd walk in the storm - still blackbirds singing I could hear
I'd walk through the desert - with pearls of dew in the heart
For a bit of love, I'd roam the world through and through,
Like the one who sings at the door and begs.
